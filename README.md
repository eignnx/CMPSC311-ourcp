# CMPSC311-ourcp
A client-server application written in C and functionally similar to the `rcp` command.

## Current Project Structure
* The [`src`](https://github.com/eignnx/CMPSC311-ourcp/tree/master/src) directory holds all source files, executables, and a makefile.
  * The makefile can be used to compile the project more easily. See contents for examples of how to use.
